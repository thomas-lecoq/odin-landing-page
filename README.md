# odin-landing-page
This is a beginner landing page made via the Odin Project html and css course.
This exercise was the occasion to practice css and more specifically the flexbox layout.

## Elements studied through this project :
- basic html structure
- use of 'div' containers
- variables in css to make containers share the same width
- flex and associated properties
- general style of a web page

## Many mistakes made through this project, this serves as a reminder on element to consider for future project :
- non atomic git commit were made
- 'section' html tag not used
- design approach was not done section by section and generate unnecessary complexity
- abuse of 'div' tag at some moment of the project
- css selectors written without a clear order of declaration
